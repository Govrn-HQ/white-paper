## Welcome to the Govrn Compendium!

Technology is enabling fascinating ways of creating, sharing and preserving knowledge. At Govrn we are constantly learning about the future of governance, innovative citizen participation practices, novel open-source tools, lessons from other entrepreneurial ventures and more. Echoing our mission to create a movement and community driven by the shared interest to open up civic participation and social change, we have created the Govrn Compendium .

This compendium is a collection of information pertaining to entrepreneurship, tech, open source, design thinking, tech, politics, governance. This collection is built out of resources that our community has come across during formal research, nerdy deep dives, and serendipitous internet finds. Our goal is to make this an organic and self-maintaining space to bring forward the resources, tools, and ideas that are shaping our movement and the future of **open source politics**.

Make the most out of the compendium following these guidelines:

Alongside these ‘traditional' elements of global politics are a host of new institutions ranging from global networks of governmental officials, to private codes of conduct for corporations, to action-oriented partnerships of NGOs, governments, corporations, and other actors. These innovative mechanisms offer intriguing solutions to pressing transnational challenges as diverse as climate change, financial governance, workers' rights, and public health. But they also raise new questions about the effectiveness and legitimacy of transnational governance."|

To meet the needs of tomorrow’s workers, today’s policy makers must grapple with these interdisciplinary policy issues. This report describes a novel design-driven approach we developed to create policy “prototype” solutions that are inherently interdisciplinary, human-centered, and inclusive for the future of work. Using our design-driven approach, we collaborated with more than 40 interdisciplinary and cross-sector thinkers and doers to generate 8 distinct policy prototypes to support the future of work. This approach shows significant potential to refine and test existing policy making processes, stimulate the development of new ideas for further development, build strong coalitions for implementation, and increase the likelihood that solutions are built with the impacted end-users in mind. Thus, we believe that such approaches should be incorporated into policy making processes more broadly. |
